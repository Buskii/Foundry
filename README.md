<h1>Read the journal in the shared data </h1>
<h2>The individual mod pages also have everything you need to know tbh</h2>

SharedData.rar : Unzip the SharedData.rar to C:\Users\YOURACCOUNT\AppData\Local\FoundryVTT\Data\modules

Obviously adjust C:\ to where ever your foundry data is stored. The other thing you can do is right click foundry in your taskbar and click Browse User Data:

This is the mod called 'Shared Data' You can also then use this for your own internal shared compendiums, but you might find the contents useful too, who knows :klomp_head:

Mod-list.txt: The mod list. You can download (most of) them through the normal foundry mod adder. you can import through here (though you'll need to enable at least Tidy UI)

cub-dnd-condition-map (1).json : And because I can't remember if it automatically adds all the conditions - Save the file, Condition Lab > Import > Choose that file and you have all the conditions set up with effects. E.g. If you give a token the prone condition, other tokens have advantage on melee attacks without any additional button presses - and the token's speed is temporarily set to zero. That kind of thing
