And because I can't remember if it automatically adds all the conditions - Save the file, Condition Lab > Import > Choose that file and you have all the conditions set up with effects. E.g.

This is the mod called 'Shared Data' You can also then use this for your own internal shared compendiums, but you might find the contents useful too, who knows :klomp_head:
